Creating a text input.
GuiManager is responsible for this.
- Small text box
- not selectable by default
- Can be given input
- will parse input
- can have the ability to autocomplete.
- it retains its value until cleared
- can have the ability to add a keybind to trigger a function

Option 1:
	- There can be a global list of objects(function + ref string)
	  That will be looked at whenever the input wants to trigger 
	  something.
Option 2:
	- We can give the input a memory adress to a vector. It will
	  look through that vector for a list of commands.
Option 3:
	- inputs can be given function pointers 1 at a time.


Option 4:
	- combine option 1 and 2.
	- Create a global list & store the memory adress ina define.


I like option 4.
Option 2 will also work with me.
Option 4 is more work and design.
Option 3 is easiest to implement now, will make future programs more frustrating

We can also combine all options. Inputs will look through
both an internal list and an outside list of functions.....
FML.... Good design or..... finish asap ??
