This is the data to set for the def_lower_case.bmp font map.

This is how the array is displayed:
	0  1  2  3  4  5 6 7
	8  9  10 11 12 ...
	....

your goal is to map the charecters to the ascii table value of them.
eg:
	If i want to start the the array with "a".... then I have to tell the program that the matrix 0 will have the ascii value of 97
	map_lower ( 0, 97 );

	the program will count up for the other charecters. If it hits another map, the count number will change to assigned map.

If you want to map only a section.... you can use the function with 3 arguments.
	map_lower ( 0, 97, 100 )

	This will map the values in indexes 0 - 3 with the numbers 97 - 100





for Def map:

map_lower( 0, 97 )			// map "a" to zero
map_lower( 30, 32 )			// map " " to 30
