Purpose:
	The program will allow me to create addons within it so that I can have 1 big program that is modular and contains Engineering programs I create
	It will be written in a way that allows new modules to be added simply and they get access to major functionality within the program

Basic Design
	2 Modes:
		- use mode
		- edit mode

	In edit mode, the user can create "screens".
		- when a user creates a screen, he will enter basic info about it
		- they the user can add "modules" to the screen
			- modules are programs that are written for stusurf. Kindof like plugins
			- the user can link multiple "modules" together if it is offered.
			- Different modules have seperate and unique uses and functionalites.

	In use mode, the user can actually use the screens created
		- The user can switch from screen to screen ( only 1 screen redered at a time )
		- The different screens have been decided when the user created them in edit mode
		- the user can use the multitude of modules within each screen
		- the user can quickly switch focus between the multiple modules in the screen.

Parts structure:

	- file format that stores program state/info/screen_data/module_data
		- everything stored in text files as string ( JSON or XML )

Modules:
	- they will have an input and an output
	- modules can request inputs from other modules
	- modules can also request input from the input handler ( mouse\keyboard )
	- every module will have a render method
	- modules also have access to common program functions
